# Command Line CRUD App - Models

In this exercise, you will create a Model, helper functions, and tests that perform behavior similar to the Python Fundamentals "Command Line CRUD App" exercise.

You should create a Model and helper functions that allow you to:

- [ ] (Create) create an arbitrary amount of items for your application to manage.
- [ ] (Read) view all of the items at once.
- [ ] (Read) search for items that satisfy some filter.
- [ ] (Read) view a single item according to some unique identifier.
- [ ] (Update) update individual items.
- [ ] (Delete) delete individual items.

Additionally, these helper functions should unit tests that help make sure there aren't bugs.

- [ ] Each helper function is tested



INVENTORY MANAGEMENT CRUD APP
-----------------------------
Model: Define a class to represent items in your inventory. Each item could have attributes such as name, description, quantity, price, and unique identifier.

Helper Functions:

Create: Function to add new items to your inventory.
Read All: Function to display all items in your inventory.
Read Filtered: Function to display items that satisfy a specific filter (e.g., items with a certain quantity or price range).
Read Single: Function to display a single item based on its unique identifier.
Update: Function to modify an existing item in your inventory.
Delete: Function to remove an item from your inventory.
Unit Tests: Write unit tests for each of the helper functions to ensure they behave as expected and handle edge cases properly.

        # for key_value_pair in extracted_data_from_model_objects:
        #     get_values = key_value_pair.values()
        #     list_one.append(get_values)

        # print(list_one)
        #     for each in get_values:
        #         list_one.append(each)
        # for item in list_one:
        #     print(item[1:])
        # print(list_one)

        #     y = []
        #     for v in item.values():

        #     for item in y:
        #         z.append(item)
        # for item in list_one[1:]:
        #     list_two.append(item)
        # if list_two == list_one[1:]:

        # print(list_one)
        # print(list_two)
        # # print(key)
        # print(value)
        #     print(ite)
        #     if each_item.values("id") in value:
        # print("yay")
        # print(list_one)
        # print(x)
