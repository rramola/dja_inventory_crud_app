# Command Line CRUD App - Models

In this exercise, you will create a Model, helper functions, and tests that perform behavior similar to the Python Fundamentals "Command Line CRUD App" exercise.

You should create a Model and helper functions that allow you to:

- [ ] (Create) create an arbitrary amount of items for your application to manage.
- [ ] (Read) view all of the items at once.
- [ ] (Read) search for items that satisfy some filter.
- [ ] (Read) view a single item according to some unique identifier.
- [ ] (Update) update individual items.
- [ ] (Delete) delete individual items.

Additionally, these helper functions should unit tests that help make sure there aren't bugs.

- [ ] Each helper function is tested
